## Description

https://burger-bar-2018.herokuapp.com/burgers

Burger Bar is a small online web application that allows the user to save name's of burgers that they would like to try in the future.

### Adding a Burger

Just by typing in a name and submitting it, a new burger will be added to the list of those the user wants to try.

### After Eating

After trying the burger, users can press the "Tried It" button to keep track of those they want to try. Burgers that have already been tried can also be entirely removed from the inventory by pressing the delete button.
